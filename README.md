# MSFS SPAD WEB

### Web Server (client)

You need to build the NextJS package for the client.

From the project's root:

```
$ cd client/
$ yarn build
```

## Running the tools

### Web Client

From the project's root:

```
$ cd client/
$ yarn start
```

This starts a NextJS server on port 3000 (default). If you want to run on different ports, please consult the NextJS documentation.

With that, you should be able to navigate from a Web browser to: `http://192.168.X.Y:3000` and start using MSFS-SPAD-WEB. If you are using a RPi with it's own screen, you can simply: `http://localhost:3000` and that's it.
